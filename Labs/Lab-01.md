## 🧪 Cisco Lab 01 - Basic Network Topology

![Network Topology](./624c9e09-9cbb-4736-84f8-92d40f5f4ab1.png)

### 🖥️ Lab Overview

This lab demonstrates a basic network topology using Cisco Packet Tracer. It showcases how two separate LANs communicate through a central router.

| Device | Interface | IP Address     | Description          |
| ------ | --------- | -------------- | -------------------- |
| Router | G0/0      | `192.168.1.1`  | Gateway for LAN 1    |
| Router | G0/1      | `192.168.2.1`  | Gateway for LAN 2    |
| PC0    | Fa0       | `192.168.1.10` | Connected to Switch0 |
| PC1    | Fa0       | `192.168.1.11` | Connected to Switch0 |
| PC2    | Fa0       | `192.168.2.10` | Connected to Switch1 |
| PC3    | Fa0       | `192.168.2.11` | Connected to Switch1 |

### 🌐 Logical Layout

* **Left Side (LAN 1)**:

  * PC0 and PC1 connect to **Switch0**
  * Switch0 uplinks to router’s **G0/0 (192.168.1.1)**

* **Right Side (LAN 2)**:

  * PC2 and PC3 connect to **Switch1**
  * Switch1 uplinks to router’s **G0/1 (192.168.2.1)**

---

### 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Router provides routing** between two different subnets: `192.168.1.0/24` and `192.168.2.0/24`.
2. Devices in each LAN can **communicate within their subnet**.
3. With correct configuration, **PCs from different LANs can communicate** via the router.

### ✅ Learning Objectives

* ✔️ Understand basic LAN-to-LAN communication
* ✔️ Practice assigning static IPs
* ✔️ Configure a router for inter-VLAN routing
* ✔️ Learn network segmentation using switches

Let me know if you want to add **routing commands**, **subnetting explanation**, or **export the .pkt file** reference too.
